The restaurants in this chain primarily serve pizza and so the institution would like recommendations on <br> where to place this new venue based on density of competitor pizza places in the area and also the ratings of these <br> other venues too. The company itself is very well known in New York and has recently acquired the funds to set up this new location<br> in the hopes that they can expand their business into Manhattan with more locations in the north to come down the line as well. I intend to analyse this data by clustering<br> it and finding a position in which there are few competitors, and also where the nearest pizza places have a low rating (so that they are not as difficult to compete with)."

To decide this optimal location, I will assess the positions <br>and ratings of each existing venue and choose a spot where there is a small number of competitors with <br>low ratings. Because of this, I will be using the \u201cSearch\u201d and \u201cLikes\u201d endpoints to acquire this data from foursquare, I will<br> also be using the K-means clustering algorithm to classify my data.<br><br>\nThe venues themselves will be local <br>pizza places such as \u201cPrince Street Pizza\u201d and \u201cJoe\u2019s Pizza\u201d, I will only be using venues in the southern areas of Manhattan<br> for this as it is the region in which the restaurant chain wishes to set up a new location. My centre point to retrieve this data<br> will be \u201cThe Sheen Center for Thought & Culture\u201d, which is a catholic-affiliated performing arts<br> complex with 2 theaters, rehearsal studios & an art gallery. From this location I will set a large radius for pizza places in Manhattan <br>and call the data with the Foursquare API.\n"
